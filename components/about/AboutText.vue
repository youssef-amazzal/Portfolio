            Hi, I'm Youssef, a student at ENSET Mohammedia with a passion for creating. I enjoy building software that
            runs smoothly and solves real problems, whether it's a personal project, a handy tool, or an automation
            script. I also have a strong interest in graphic design and love working on visuals that make things not
            just functional, but beautiful and user-friendly.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, great work is about finding the right balance between technical precision and thoughtful design. I
            believe that the best products come from paying close attention to both how they work and how they feel to
            use.
